This project represents a comprehensive exploration into the realm of credit card fraud detection, leveraging a diverse array of machine learning algorithms. In response to the staggering annual financial losses incurred through fraudulent credit card activities, this endeavor aims to mitigate such losses through the development and implementation of robust fraud detection models. The utilization of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Network models on the dataset—initially partitioned into training and test sets via the caTools library—unveiled distinct insights and challenges. These algorithms, while promising, confront significant hurdles stemming from the dynamic nature of data distribution, prevalent class imbalances, and the continuous influx of transactional data. Addressing these challenges becomes imperative in enhancing fraud detection mechanisms, particularly considering the scarcity of publicly available data due to confidentiality concerns. The project aligns with the critical need for credit card companies to discern fraudulent transactions, ensuring customers are safeguarded from unwarranted charges, ultimately bolstering trust and reliability within financial systems.
